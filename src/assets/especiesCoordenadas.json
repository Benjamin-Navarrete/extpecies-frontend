    "descripcionGeografica": "The Bull Shark has a circumglobal distribution (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014, SEAFDEC 2016, Arunrugstichai et al. 2018, Arai and Azri 2019, Deng 2019, Iqbal et al. 2019, Psomadakis et al. 2019, Soria et al. 2019, M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",

    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",

Dicken unpubl. data 2021). The species travels large distances up rivers and remains in freshwater for extended periods of time. It has currently been documented from 125 freshwater rivers and lakes across all continents in its range and likely occurs in any river within its range of suitable depth, temperature, current, and available prey (Thomerson and Thorson 1977, Pillans and Franklin 2004, Gausmann 2018).

    "detallesPoblacion": "Genetic data indicate genetic structuring between and within ocean basins with female philopatry and male-biased dispersal (Tillett et al. 2012, Sandoval Laurrabaquio-A et al. 2019, Pirog et al. 2019). Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) Northwest Atlantic (Carlson et al. 2012, J. Carlson unpubl. data 2020) and (2) Western Indian Ocean (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley et al. 2020, Winker et al. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generation lengths (see the Supplementary Information).First, the relative abundance index based on observer data from the United States commercial bottom longline fishery in the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico for 1994–2009 indicated that the Bull Shark abundance had fluctuated but steadily increased (Carlson et al. 2012). The trend analysis of the relative abundance index updated with more recent data, i.e., for 1994–2018 (25 years) revealed an annual rate of increase of 9.3%, consistent with an estimated median increase over three generation lengths (63 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over three generation lengths (63 years). Long term fishery independent surveys in coastal estuaries of Texas, Gulf of Mexico from 1976 to 2010 (35 years) also reported Bull Shark abundance increased, particularly after management measures were introduced in 1993 (Froeschke et al. 2012).Second, the standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) from the Kwazulu-Natal South Africa beach protection (KZNSBP) for 1981–2019 initially rose, declined markedly, then steadily declined followed by an increase in recent years (M. Dicken and H. Winker unpubl. data 2020). The trend analysis of the data for 1981–2019 (39 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 68.3% over three generation lengths (80 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (80 years). The trend analysis should be interpreted with caution as it is influenced by the marked drop in CPUE in the first few years of data collection in the KZNSBP, which is more a reflection of the high capture rates of more resident Bull Sharks at the netted beaches in the first few years of the program rather than a decline in the population of Bull Sharks in the region. Bull Sharks were, and are still, present in significant numbers at reefs near to the netted beaches (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). Tagging of Bull Sharks over the past eight years has revealed the animals move between South Africa and Mozambique with ~80% of the animals alive over that period which indicates a low fishing mortality rate in the region (R. Daly pers. comm. 5 February 2021). There are also more Bull Sharks observed now compared to 1980–2000 in areas outside Kwazulu-Natal, such as the Eastern Cape and in the Breede River (Western Cape) (M. Dicken unpubl. data 2021). These additional data reinforce that the decline noted in CPUE from the KZNSBP over-estimated the level of actual decline. Some decline in Bull Sharks in South Africa is suspected due to habitat loss, for e.g. the degradation of St Lucia estuary (their former primary nursery area), with the population reduction suspected to be 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (80 years).In the Arabian Seas region, there have been no dedicated surveys or population estimates for the Bull Shark. Throughout the region it is commonly confused with the Pigeye Shark, making landing records more difficult to interpret. Surveys in Kuwait found that the Bull Shark made up 1.7–2.3% of elasmobranchs landed, but was much rarer in Qatar (0.05%) and absent in Bahrain (Moore et al. 2012, Moore and Pierce 2013). In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it makes up 1.3% of shark landings by number (Jabado et al. 2015), and in Iran, 2–3% of shark landings by number (T. Valinassab unpubl. data 2017). It is caught in Oman where it is not uncommon (Henderson and Reeve 2014) and it comprised 5% of sharks transported from Oman to the UAE by number (Jabado et al. 2015). It makes up less than 1% of catches by number in Pakistan with evidence suggesting declines of about 80% since the 1990s (M. Khan pers. comm. 09 February 2017). Bull sharks are commonly caught in India (Kizhakudan et al. 2015), but rarely in Sri Lanka (Fernando 2014). Data available from India is from the Cochin Fish Harbour where this species represented 3.6% of shark landings by number in 1986–1987, but this number declined to 0.1% in 2006–2007 (Akhilesh et al. 2011). Fisheries in the region have experienced increased demand for sharks since the 1970s due to the shark fin trade and as a result, effort is increasing in traditional shark fisheries in many areas (Henderson et al. 2007, Jabado et al. 2015). Simultaneously, there has been a significant increase in coastal fishing effort and power in some parts of the Arabian Seas region leading to a reduction in the number of shark catches.In Panama, Pacific Ocean, the abundance of Bull Shark was noted by artisanal fishers as scarce in 2009–2011 (Rodríguez-Arriati 2011). Elsewhere, species-specific population trend data is limited for the Bull Shark. However, catches for all combined whaler sharks (Carcharhinidae), Carcharhinus spp., Hardnose Shark (Carcharhinus macloti), Spottail Shark (C. sorrah), Tawny Nurse Shark (Nebrius ferrugineus), and houndsharks (Triakidae) have been reconstructed for 1950–2016 based on landings data from the Large Marine Ecosystems; LMEs 30–41, 44, and 45 (i.e., Agulhas Current, Somali Coastal Current, Arabian Sea, Red Sea, Bay of Bengal, Gulf of Thailand, South China Sea, Sulu-Celebes Sea, Indonesian Sea, North Australia, Northeast Australia, East Central Australia, West-Central Australia, and Northwest Australia) (Pauly et al. 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to calculate population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. Across the LMEs, there is no reason to suspect that overall fishing effort has decreased. In fact, as human coastal population continues to grow and as fishing technology and market access improves, fishing effort and power is continuing to increase globally, with some of the highest increases in Southeast Asia (Anticamara et al. 2011, Watson et al. 2013). Catch levels of the whaler sharks grew rapidly through the 1960s and 1970s to a peak of 141,117 t in 1983. Catch then declined to 71,772 t in 2016 representing a 49% decline over 33 years (Pauly et al. 2020). This is equivalent to a 73% reduction when scaled to an average three generation length across the region of the Bull Shark (68 years). This level of reduction is not species-specific and should be used with caution as the proportion of Bull Sharks in the whaler shark complex is unknown, but it is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region.In Australia, the Bull Shark is common across its range. It may have declined in parts of the east coast where a long-term CPUE decline of 82% in whaler sharks combined occurred from 1962 to 2017 in the Queensland Shark Control Program (QSCP) (Roff et al. 2018). The Bull Shark catches in the QSCP were high in the early years of the Program, they then declined rapidly and were low until the early 1990s when they rose rapidly as drum-line effort increased, however, by the late 1990s, catches had rapidly declined (Cardno 2019); this suggests that the overall decline in Bull Shark abundance is a contributor to the 82% decrease in whalers combined (Roff et al. 2018). Elsewhere in Australia, catches are relatively low and not at levels likely to lead to population reduction (for e.g., Harry et al. 2011).Across the regions, the Bull Shark is estimated to be increasing in the Northwest Atlantic where management measures are in place and decreasing in South Africa, mostly due to habitat degradation. Elsewhere, there is limited information on population trends, however, increasing demand for the fin trade over part of the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (55–80 years), the presence of intensive fisheries, and inshore and riverine habitat degradation mean that like many other carcharhinids, it will have undergone population declines. The declines across the LMEs equate to a 73% reduction in all carcharhinids over the past three generation lengths of the Bull Shark (68 years) which is not species-specific but is informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks. The Bull Shark is still reported to be commonly caught in some parts of its range though declines are suspected. Overall, it is suspected that the Bull Shark has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (55–80 years) due to a decline in habitat quality and levels of exploitation.",
    "sistemaHabitat": "Freshwater (=Inland waters)",
    "tiposHabitat": "Wetlands (inland), Marine Neritic, Marine Coastal/Supratidal, ",
    "detallesHabitat": "The Bull Shark is demersal and pelagic in tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate waters both inshore and offshore, usually near the seabed from the surf line to a depth of 164 m (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016), but mostly in shallower waters to ~30 m depth. It has recently been recorded to a depth of 256 m in South Africa (R. Daly pers. comm 5 February 2021). The species is euryhaline; it commonly moves into estuarine and fresh waters where females normally give birth and the young can remain for up to five years (Heupel and Simpfendorfer 2008, Curtis et al. 2011, Werry et al. 2012). Males and females have been reported to undertake long-range migrations along the coastlines of the United States east coast, South Africa, and Australia (Castro 1983, Daly et al. 2014, Heupel et al. 2015). Adults are known to use a wide range of coastal habitats with a high dependence on coral reefs (Daly et al. 2014, Espinoza et al. 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 400 cm total length (TL) (McCord and Lamberth 2009, Werry 2010), but is mostly reported to be 340–366 cm total maximum length (Ebert et al. 2013, Weigmann 2016). Males mature at 157–226 cm TL and females mature at 180–230 cm TL (Moore et al. 2012, Ebert et al. 2013, Jabado et al. 2016). Reproduction is placental viviparous with litter sizes of 1–15 pups (usually 6–8 pups), a likely biennial reproductive cycle and size-at-birth of 56–81 cm TL (Pattillo et al. 1997, Werry 2010, Ebert et al. 2013, Nevill et al. 2014). Age estimates vary regionally; in Australia and South Africa, female age-at-maturity is 9.5 and 21 years and maximum age is 27 and 32 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 18.2 and 26.5 years, respectively (Wintner et al. 2002, Tillett et al. 2011). In the Northwest Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, female age-at-maturity is 15 and 10–18 years and maximum age is 27 and 24–28 years, respectively; thus, generation length is 21 and 19–21 years, respectively (Branstetter and Stiles 1987, Cruz-Martínez et al. 2005, Natanson et al. 2014).",
    "detallesAmenazas": "The Bull Shark is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is caught as target and bycatch in artisanal, industrial, and recreational fisheries across its range with multiple fishing gears including gillnet, longline, and trawl. It is mostly retained for its meat and fins. The species is also targeted in beach protection programs in South Africa, Réunion, and Australia that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer et al. 2010, Reid et al. 2011, Guyomard et al. 2020). This species’ preference for inshore coastal waters, estuarine, and riverine habitats means it is also threatened by habitat loss and degradation, including pollution and clearing, and climate change. The reliance on rivers and estuaries by juveniles means that this species faces threats from habitat degradation caused by damming, agriculture, and coastal development (Werry 2010). Global climate change has already resulted in large-scale coral bleaching events with increasing frequency causing worldwide reef degradation since 1997. Almost all warm-water coral reefs are projected to suffer significant losses of area and local extinctions, even if global warming is limited to 1.5ºC (IPCC Report 2019).",
    "accionesConservacion": "Species-specific measures are in place in the United States (US) where the Bull Shark is managed under the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Fishery Management Plan. Management measures first implemented in 1993 include limited permits, commercial and recreational quotas and limits, gear restrictions, and mandatory shark identification workshops for shark dealers. Closures of coastal waters in several states in the southern US to gillnets have removed pressure from the juveniles in estuarine and coastal nursery areas.In Australia, 33% of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park comprises no-fishing zones which likely provides some protection to the Bull Shark. In South Africa, fishing effort by the KwaZulu-Natal shark nets has been reduced in order to reduce captures of all exploited species. Elsewhere, many countries in the Arabian Seas region have banned targeted fishing for sharks (e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Maldives), but incidental catches occur in other fisheries. Seasonal bans on shark fishing are in place in Iran and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The UAE, Qatar, and Oman have banned trawling in their waters (since 1980, 1993 and 2011, respectively) while Iran, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and India have seasonal trawl bans that might benefit the species. However, incidental catches occur in other fisheries (e.g. gillnets). In Indonesia, in 1980, trawls were banned from use, however, mini trawls (Lampara) are still used throughout the country (Chong et al. 1987). Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.",
